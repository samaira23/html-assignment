            <h1>What is AI?</h1>
            <p>AI allows computers to learn and solve problems almost like a person.
                AI systems are trained on huge amounts of information and learn to identify the patterns in it, in order carry out tasks such as having human-like conversation, or predicting a product an online shopper might buy.</p>
            <p>The technology is behind the voice-controlled virtual assistants Siri and Alexa, and helps Facebook and X - formerly known as Twitter- decide which social media posts to show users.</p>
            <p> These programs learn from vast quantities of data, such as online text and images, to generate new content which feels like it has been made by a human.
                So-called chatbots - like ChatGPT - can have text conversations.
                Other AI programs like Midjourney can create images from simple text instructions.
                Generative AI can also make videos and even produce music in the style of famous musicians.
                But these programs sometimes generate inaccurate answers and images, and can reproduce the bias contained in their source material, such as sexism or racism.</p>
